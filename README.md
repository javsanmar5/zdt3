# zdt3_javsanmar5

## Description
`zdt3_javsanmar5` is a Python project that resolves the ZDT3 problem using an evolutionary algorithm. The ZDT3 problem is a well-known multi-objective optimization problem used for benchmarking optimization algorithms.

## Features
- Implements an evolutionary algorithm to solve the ZDT3 problem.
- Includes mutation and neighborhood update mechanisms.
- Tracks and updates the best solutions found during the iterations.
