8. Are there any licensing details?

Please provide the answers to these questions, and I'll generate a README for you.

javsanmar5: the name of the project is zdt3_javsanmar5, it resolves the zdt3 problem with an evolutive algorithm, the installation is just clone, install python create an env and install the requirements fil, there are anything else

GitHub Copilot: Based on the information provided, here is a README for your project:

# zdt3_javsanmar5

## Description
`zdt3_javsanmar5` is a Python project that resolves the ZDT3 problem using an evolutionary algorithm. The ZDT3 problem is a well-known multi-objective optimization problem used for benchmarking optimization algorithms.

## Features
- Implements an evolutionary algorithm to solve the ZDT3 problem.
- Includes mutation and neighborhood update mechanisms.
- Tracks and updates the best solutions found during the iterations.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zdt3_javsanmar5.git
    cd zdt3_javsanmar5
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh

    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the algorithm, execute the following command:
```sh
python Algorithm.py
```
